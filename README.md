===============================

Use the Arrow Keys - up, right, down and left, to move your player figures. Avoid the lady-bugs; they bite! Touch the star on the other side of the road before you can advance to the next game level. There are five lives for each game.

Game level and lives left are displayed on the screen. My kids asked me to add the history game level to the game as they were trying to beat their own records.

Have fun!
